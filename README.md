The PTG Form is currently manually filled in Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering. Each student is assigned one form of almost eight pages. For updating these forms, regular meeting are conducted in which filling of this form is done. This project aims at removal of this manual process and automate it. The main.py file contains the code for all the logic and database connectivity parts. Design parts of the appication can be created according to requirements. The imported classes, such as 'regforms' for example, are of various designed UI pages of the application.
